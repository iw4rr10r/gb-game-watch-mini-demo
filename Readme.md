# Game Watch Mini Demo for the Gamebuino META

This code is a mini-project to consider as a starting point for the implementation of a High Resolution game for the Gamebuino META, inspired by Nintendo's Game Watch console series.

It responds to a request from [Jicehel](https://gamebuino.com/@jicehel) made on the official Gamebuino forum. I wrote it in haste to help Jicehel realize the project of his dreams...

A complete tutorial on how to make this type of game could be created if I find the time to write it...
